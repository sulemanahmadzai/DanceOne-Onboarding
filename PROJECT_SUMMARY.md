# DanceOne Onboarding Hub - Project Delivery

Dear Client,

I am pleased to deliver the DanceOne Onboarding Hub project that I have created for you.

**Live Application**: [xyz.com](xyz.com)

## Overview

I have successfully created and delivered the DanceOne Onboarding Hub, a comprehensive role-based web application designed to streamline employee onboarding for dance tour companies. Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Supabase, the platform facilitates a seamless three-stage workflow from initial hire request to final HR completion.

## Core Functionality

**Multi-Role System**: Four user roles with tailored access:

- **National Directors (ND)**: Create and manage new hire requests, submit candidate information including tour assignments, position details, compensation rates, and employment classifications. Track status through dashboards.

- **Human Resources (HR)**: Oversee all onboarding requests. Can view, edit, and complete candidate information on behalf of candidates. Filtering by tour name, status, and search.

- **Administrators**: Full system access including user management, invitations, and unified oversight. View statistics, manage users, and export records.

- **Candidates**: Receive secure tokenized email invitations to complete personal information forms.

## Key Features

**Three-Stage Workflow**: ND form → Candidate information → HR finalization with ADP integration. Visual progress tracking.

**Tour Management**: 15+ predefined tours plus custom entry option.

**ADP Integration**: Worker categories (1099/W2) and hire types (HIRE/REHIRE) match ADP requirements exactly.

**Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering by tour name, status, and full-text search.

**Edit Capabilities**: HR and Admin can edit submitted forms and complete candidate forms on their behalf.

**Data Integrity**: Duplicate email prevention for in-progress candidates.

**Performance & Security**: Cookie-based role caching, server-side data fetching, role-based access control.

## Technical Stack

Next.js App Router with Server Components, Drizzle ORM, Material-UI, and Supabase. Optimized for performance.

## Deliverables

A fully functional, production-ready onboarding management system that reduces manual processing time, improves data accuracy, and provides comprehensive visibility. All features implemented, tested, and operational.
